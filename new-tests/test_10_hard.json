        "7": "Text 1\n\nFrench Impressionist artist Edgar Degas insisted that his paintings be kept in their original\nframes after they were sold. Like many Impressionist painters, Degas used painted frames\nthat stood in contrast to the gold frames frequently seen at the Paris Salon, a prestigious art\nexhibition that was sponsored by the French government and promoted traditional\npainting styles. Impressionist painters likely chose these colorful frames to distinguish\nthemselves from what was considered conventional at the time.\n\nText 2\n\nImpressionist painters often focused on the interplay of color and light in their works. As\nsuch, those Impressionists who placed their works in painted frames instead of the more\ntraditional gold ones did so for aesthetic reasons: a frame\u2019s color was likely chosen because\nit would harmonize with the colors or subjects in a painting. Gold, conversely, could\ndistract from the subtleties in a painted scene.\n",

These elements\ninclude leather fringe and jingles, the metal cones that cover the dresses worn in the jingle\ndance, a women\u2019s dance of the Ojibwe people. Thus, Gibson combines an object commonly\nassociated with masculinity (a punching bag) with art forms traditionally practiced by\nwomen in most Native communities (beadwork and dressmaking).

Scientists have assumed that this feature helps to attract mates but\ncould also attract predators.
